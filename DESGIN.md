# Current Design Thoughts

## Background
The following design is for a Chrome extension that will identify code blocks in HTML and provide an editor-like experience for them. The primary feature it will support is providing definitions for parts of code, such as classes or functions, when hovered over. This experience will be similar to what you get in an editor like VSCode, but without the need for an LSP or editor—hence the name Vibey LSP.

### Markdown
```html
<code class="whitespace-pre! language-python">
<span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span>
    <span> </span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_">main</span>
    <span>():</span>
</span>
<br>
<span>
    <span>  </span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>
    <span>(</span>
    <span class="hljs-string">"Hello, World!"</span>
    <span>)</span>
</span>
<br>
<br>
<span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>
    <span> __name__ == </span>
    <span class="hljs-string">"__main__"</span>
    <span>:</span>
</span>
<br>
<span>
    <span>  main()</span>
</span>
</code>
```


### POC Tasks
* Preprocess LLM HTML input
* Make LLM return structured json object rather then HTML to avoid prompt injection and lead to better consistency and improve LLM prompt
* Pick a good LLM
* Stream json response rather then wait for the whole thing
* Scrub inputs to service workers
* Add effect to code tokens that have definitions

### Bugs
* Figure out why extension does not always fire for code blocks

### House Keeping
* Clean up `processCodeBlocks.ts`
